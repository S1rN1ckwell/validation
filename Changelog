RELEASE 2.0.2
=============

- Fixed the context for rules BR-S-08 and BR-Z-08 to only check on the document level.
- Applied the same context rule fixes for VATE, VATAE, and all other VAT types.
- Updated the CEN validation artefacts, from commit 20159a3a to 3cb9fda3. This includes a fixed check to allow for UBLVersionID (which is now allowed, as long as it is 2.1).


RELEASE 2.0.1
=============

2019-06-03:
- Updated the CenPC434 UBL rules from release 1.1.0 to release 1.2.1 (from https://github.com/CenPC434/validation/, commit c750263a to commit 20159a3a), see https://github.com/CenPC434/validation/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av1.2 and https://github.com/CenPC434

2019-05-28:
- Rewrote the rules for BR-NL-1 and BR-NL-10: As the rules were, it resulted in an XLST error on a document with multiple AccountingSupplierParty/PartyLegalEntity fields. Such documents should result in either a warning UBL-SR-09, UBL-SR-11, UBL-SR-15 or UBL-SR-17, not a total failure. The fixes are slightly more extensive, since we do still need to check whether at least one value is either '0106' or '0190'.

2019-05-07:
- SI-UBL 2.0: Fix in check for rule BR-NL-10: cac:AccountingCustomerParty/cac:Party/cac:PartyLegalEntity/cbc:CompanyID is mandatory if sender and receiver are from the Netherlands. It already checked whether the schemeID was 0106 or 0190 but the test also passed if the element was not present.

2019-05-06:
- Fixed the check for SI-UBL 1.2 /ubl:Invoice/cac:InvoiceLine/cac:Item/cac:OriginCountry/cbc:IdentificationCode/@listID, which should be ISO3166-1:Alpha2 (the checked value was 3166-1:Alpha2, without the ISO).


RELEASE 2.0
===========

2019-03-15:
- Release of SI-UBL-2.0 artefacts
- Tagged release 2.0

2019-03-01:
- Updated the SI-UBL-1.2 PEPPOL and BII rules to the fall 2018 release.
- Removed the 'all versions' schematron file; versions are now done separately
- Fixed a few old issues in SI-UBL-1.1 validation:
  * Backported a fix from SI-UBL-1.2: The check for SI-INV-V11-R453 (missing BillingReference) was wrong
  * Backported a fix from later PEPPOL releases for BII2-T10-R032: The check was in the wrong context
  * Backported a fix from later PEPPOL releases for BII2-T10-R058: The check was in the wrong context
