- Release of SI-UBL-2.0 artefacts

2019-03-01:
- Updated the SI-UBL-1.2 PEPPOL and BII rules to the fall 2018 release.
- Removed the 'all versions' schematron file; versions are now done separately
- Fixed a few old issues in SI-UBL-1.1 validation:
  * Backported a fix from SI-UBL-1.2: The check for SI-INV-V11-R453 (missing BillingReference) was wrong
  * Backported a fix from later PEPPOL releases for BII2-T10-R032: The check was in the wrong context
  * Backported a fix from later PEPPOL releases for BII2-T10-R058: The check was in the wrong context

(older changes may be found in the git log)
