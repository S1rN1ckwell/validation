validation
==========

Contains all files related to validation of the simplerinvoicing xml files.

The validation is based on Schematron; specified in the file SI-UBL-INV.SCH.

An XSLT-file based on the schematron definition is also provided; for
SI-UBL-1.1 this is currently SI-UBL-INV-1.1.1.xsl.

You can recreate this XSLT file by running one of the conversion scripts.

An overview of the applicable rules can be found in rules-overview.html
(generated from the generated XSLT file).
